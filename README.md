# Transparent Image Project

## About
This mini-project aims to help the user determine if an image they have found online has any transparency. I have often run into problems online where it looks like an image has a transparent background but more often than not it doesn't have one when I download it. This software will help to automate the task of downloading and determining if an image has any transparency.
This software should work on most image types that support transparency, such as, png and webp.

## Compatability
- [X] Linux
- [X] Windows
- [ ] MacOS


## Features
- Takes a URL to an image and determines if it has transparency

## Todo
- Maybe add a GUI using QT
- Allow to user to input multiple URLs
